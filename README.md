# Java Practice Exercises ‚òïÔ∏è

This repository contains a collection of practice problems, examples, and mini-projects I've worked on while learning the Java programming language. The goal is to document my learning journey and reinforce core and advanced Java concepts.

## Topics Covered
- Java basics (variables, conditions, loops, etc.)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) fundamentals and advanced concepts, including:
  - Encapsulation with access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `static`)
  - Method overloading and overriding
  - Inheritance (parent and child classes)
  - Polymorphism
  - Abstract classes and Interfaces
  - Inner and nested classes
  - Java Reflection API usage
- Arrays and Collections
- Exception Handling
- Classes and Methods
- Small projects and algorithm challenges

## How to Use
Feel free to explore each folder. Most exercises are documented with inline comments for clarity.  
Advanced OOP concepts are organized in dedicated folders to facilitate progressive learning.
